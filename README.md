# Adv_mini_project1
This mini project involves creating a multi-user chat application using C++ and sockets. The application will allow multiple clients to connect to a central server, send messages to each other, and see messages from other users in real-time. This project will help students understand network programming, multi-threading, and basic GUI development.
